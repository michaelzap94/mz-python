# ThreadPoolExecutor allows you to create a bunch of Threads with NO target (Pool) so we can use the Pool to execute jobs(Functions)

# IOW-> have a bunch of Threads(max_workers) waiting AND ask them to do something ^ get result back multiple times
# without having to be always creating new Threads. 
# This way you don't have to create Threads for every single function all the time.

# USE "with" so we don't have to call pool.shutdown()

	pool.submit(complex_calculation)
	pool.submit(ask_user)
